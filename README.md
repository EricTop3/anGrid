Dependencies: angular.js.

##About##

This is an easy frontend grid plugin for angularjs.

Although there are lots of grid plugin such as ng-grid, jqgrid and flexigrid, I also need a grid plugin made by myself.
For one reason, in the face of changing needs, we need to be able to flexibly update code.
For another reason, build a plugin by myself is an interesting process.
